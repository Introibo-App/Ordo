/**
 * The temporal skeleton of the Time after Pentecost — the long green season from
 * Trinity Sunday to the eve of Advent, the "Tempus per annum post Pentecosten".
 *
 * `forYear($year)` fills every day from the first Sunday after Pentecost (Trinity
 * Sunday, Easter+56) up to the First Sunday of Advent under the 1960 rubrics.
 * `$year` is the year Easter falls (Advent of that same year closes the season).
 * Eastertide (#20) hands off at Trinity Sunday. Everything is the green
 * {@see Season::pentecost()} season.
 *
 * The number of Sundays after Pentecost varies with the date of Easter (an early
 * Easter gives a long green season, a late Easter a short one). Two rules make
 * the count come out right for every year: the **last** Sunday before Advent
 * always takes the "24th and last" Mass, and when a year has more than 24
 * Sundays, the **Sundays after Epiphany that were crowded out before
 * Septuagesima are resumed** here, filling the slots between the 23rd Sunday and
 * the last. So the leftover Epiphany Sundays are never dropped — they reappear
 * with their own office while the count of Sundays after Pentecost stays
 * continuous.
 *
 * This is the *temporal skeleton*: the Easter-anchored feasts that overlay the
 * early weeks (the Most Holy Trinity, Corpus Christi, the Sacred Heart) and the
 * month-computed September Ember days are deferred to the movable-feast (#22) and
 * later passes; the skeleton emits the underlying green Sunday or feria beneath
 * them. See docs/design/temporal-fill-model.md.
