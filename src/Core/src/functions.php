/**
 * The engine entry point: the liturgical day for a civil date.
 *
 * Returns the resolved {@see LiturgicalDay} — its celebration, commemorations,
 * displaced offices, and tempora. Because a transferred feast makes any day depend
 * on earlier ones, the whole civil year is resolved once and memoised for the life
 * of the process, so repeated calls within a year are cheap. A {@see DateTimeImmutable}
 * is required so the returned day cannot be changed out from under the caller.
 *
 * `$calendar` selects the particular calendar to resolve under (#78): null for the
 * universal calendar, or a calendar named by its slug (`sspx`) or overlay URN
 * (`directorium:overlay:roman:sspx`). `$rubricSystem` selects the edition (rules-family):
 * null for the default 1962 (Rubricae 1960), or `roman:divino-afflatu` (1954) /
 * `roman:rubricae-1955` (1955), or a friendly alias (`1954`, `1955`, `1962`). The two
 * selectors are orthogonal (an overlay is layered over an edition), and both default so
 * `day($date)` resolves the universal 1962 calendar exactly as before.
