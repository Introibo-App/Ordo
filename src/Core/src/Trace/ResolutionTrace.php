/**
 * The show-your-work trace for one resolved day (#233): the whole field of offices
 * that competed, which one was celebrated and why, what became of each office it
 * beat, and how many commemorations the day admitted — every step reasoned and, where
 * a rubric governs it, cited.
 *
 * The trace is built by the resolver from the *actual* sorted candidates and the
 * *actual* outcomes ({@see \Directorium\Core\Precedence\DayResolver}), so it reports the
 * resolution as it was decided, not a reconstruction. It is opt-in: it fills the
 * output contract's reserved day-level `resolution` slot only when a caller asks to
 * explain a day, so the default contract stays lean and byte-stable. Tier positions
 * are carried as plain data (ordinal/line/selector), so this layer stays free of the
 * Precedence types that build it. Colour and season derivation (#235) extend this
 * shape additively. See docs/design/resolution-trace-model.md.
 *
 * @phpstan-type TraceTier array{ordinal: int, line: int|null, selector: string|null}
